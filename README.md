## Absence Manager

I felt the necessity to create an interface for my project, so I created this simple one and I'll let some instruction below.

### Prerequisites
1. `npm i`

### Running
1. `npm start` 

### Interface Usage

1. To list all absences don't enter any id or date on input, just click on **List Absences**;
2. Once you enter an userId and then enter any date, the userId field will be reset or vice-versa;
3. If you enter a nonexistent userId no absences will be showen;
4. If you choose date interval, that don't exist any data, no absences will be showen;
5. When you click on _Add Absence To Calendar_ it will generate an event for the absence you clicked; 
6. When you click on dowload button, it'll **always** download all absences.
